//! A wasm-specific guard on provider declarations.
//!
//! An information provider's Rhai script may be given inline (`script`) or as an
//! external file (`scriptFile`) resolved relative to the declarations file. Only
//! `ProviderDeclarations::from_json_file` resolves the latter — it reads the
//! referenced file into `script`. These bindings take declarations as *text*
//! (there is no file to be relative to), and `wasm32-unknown-unknown` has no
//! filesystem at all, so a `scriptFile` reference can never be resolved here.
//!
//! Left alone that is a **false green**: `from_json` accepts the declaration —
//! it is structurally valid — so `checkProviders` reports `ok: true`, and the
//! provider then fails closed at authorize time, turning every policy that calls
//! it into a deny. The check passes and the policy silently stops permitting
//! anything.
//!
//! So every entry point that accepts provider text runs [`parse_declarations`]
//! instead of `from_json` directly, which rejects an unresolvable `scriptFile`
//! up front with an actionable message. This lives outside [`ops`](crate::ops)
//! deliberately: that module is verbatim from `dogwood-cli`, where `scriptFile`
//! does work.
